RHS Robotics Website Development Guide:

Hello fellow developer! 
This is the original developer guide for the RHS Robotics Website Code! Glad
you are here!

First off, you are coding using ASTRO and TAILWIND. Previously, the Website
was based off of PUG and BOOTSTRAP, but was updated using these newer languages.

- What is Astro?
Astro is essentially very good at making simple websites that don't need backend
or servers to run. Perfect for us, but if you're interested in making systems that
involve backend, such as a login system, saving any data, etc, it is not
recommended. 
In addition, Astro has plenty of developer features and storage of values that
makes website create EASY.

- What is Tailwind?
Tailwind is modern bootstrap. But if you're asking what bootstrap is, don't worry,
I was there too. Bootstrap may seem complicated, but it simplifies CSS so that you
don't need to write each CSS line or any at all, instead puting the CSS inside
HTML. This makes code significantly easier to read.

- What do you need?
As an extension, are you will need is Astro. From there, you will need Node to run
Astro and Tailwind. It may seem complicated, but it really isn't. Please, if you're
struggling, you can message me (eBooked) on discord or USE AI. (SERIOUSLY USE AI,
it is very helpful for everything).
