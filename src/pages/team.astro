				<p class="text-lm-text-muted-alt dark:text-dm-text-muted text-lg max-w-4xl leading-relaxed">
					The engineering department is composed of two separate sub-teams which work together to design and build the robot. 
					Before the build season, both sub-teams hold curriculum meetings to teach newer members how to operate workshop tools 
					and use CAD programs. In addition, they teach basic design processes so everyone can help with the final design. 
					Throughout the build season, the engineering department is responsible for designing and building the robot within the 
					timeframe. During competition, department members are the primary group in the pit, so they can fix any problems that may 
					arise.

					The Software Department is responsible for the backend of the robot. Before the build season, they teach newer members 
					how to use Java and the tools they use to code, such as VSCode. During the build season, they write the code for the robot,
					including not only basic driving and manipulator control, but also image recognition, motion profiling, and more. They test
					the robot rigorously to ensure everything works as expected, which is then handed off to Drive Team.
